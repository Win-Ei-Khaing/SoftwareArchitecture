I've finished all parts of Lab10 assignment with my best by referencing the Professor's Demo code for Part2 and 3. On Part3, after changing config file from local or native to Git, greeting and message auto-wire does not work. I tried my best to pass that error but I couldn't get it after 1 hour.

I hereby declare that this submission is my own original work and to the best of my knowledge it contains no materials previously published or written by another person. I am aware that submitting solutions that are not my own work will result in an NC of the course. I am aware that I am not allowed to share solutions with other students. I am aware that if I submit only parts of this lab that points will be subtracted. I am aware that if my lab submission does not contain this readme.txt file that I do not get points for this lab.Win Ei Khaing
